                <p>It is debatable whether if the Uganda Martyrs had not been killed in 1886 , this
                    school would have been founded.But what is not disputable is the fact that the martyrdom
                    guided the founders , 85 years later , on the name Uganda Martyrs'S.S Namugongo.  
                </p>
                <p>With Fifty four years down the road , and growing stronger : the inspiration of the Martyrs had been
                    indelible so much that they are extolled in the School Anthem and are implored daily to intercede for 
                    and bestow blessings on the school community. The school was founded by Late Msgr.Lawrence Mbwega , the 
                    parish priest then , who wrote a book in which he stated that three people should never be forgotten when
                    naming founders of Uganda Martyrs S.S Namugongo : Jeremiah MunyigWa (deceased) , Hellen Namazzi and Joseph
                    Mugerwa. The trio rallied the parents of Namugongo Catholic Parish and in 1967 they started a humble project 
                    that has after fifty years become larger tha life .
